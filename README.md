# DISCLAIMER: All meetups are fictional!

### Web App built with NextJS, MongoDB database, and deployed with Vercel
  *See instructions below to get started with NextJS*
  
## Things I would like to add to this app:
1. More generic homepage with description of purpose of meetups
2. Disclaimer at bottom of homepage
3. Format the way the date is displayed! 
6. Option to add comments/more details to the "show details page"  









This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
