# React World Meetups

## Description
This web app is a place for all React developers to find a local social meetup to attend and network with other developers, and even add new locations for a meetup! I created this as an expansion of a project I worked on while learning React to be able to put my skills to the test and solidify my knowledge in these technologies.

###### DISCLAIMER: All meetups are fictional!

## Launch
Visit this site: [React World Meetups](https://react-world-meetups-nextjs.vercel.app)

*See instructions below to get started with NextJS*
#### Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

#### Deploy on Vercel
The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
