# DISCLAIMER: All meetups are fictional!

### Web App built with NextJS, MongoDB database, and deployed with Vercel
  *See instructions below to get started with NextJS*
  
## Things I would like to add to this app:
1. More generic homepage with description of purpose of meetups
2. Disclaimer at bottom of homepage
3. Ability to add a date when setting a new meetup
4. Pop up message that says "Thank you for creating a new meetup" after you add a new meetup with an 'ok' button that will redirect to the homepage
5. Add "cancel" button on the add meetup page
6. Option to add comments/more details to the "show details page"
7. "back" button on the show details page that will take you back to all meetups 
 - top right, make sure the button is sticky
8. React Meetups title will be clickable to take you back to main homepage 
9. "Meetup Title" input needs to include example so the user knows to include the country in the title. 









This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
